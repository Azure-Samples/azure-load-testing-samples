# Results integration

Azure Load Testing (ALT) provides a unified dashboard of test statistics, client-side metrics, and server-side metrics so that the performance bottlenecks can be easily identified. While the out of the box dashboard is helpful in most scenarios, you might want the load test results to be available in a tool of your choice. 

This is a sample set up to integrate and automaically visualize Azure Load Testing results in a dashboarding tool like PowerBI. 

Information on a sample sceanrio and instructions to use are available at https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/automated-and-customized-dashboards-for-azure-load-testing/ba-p/3786891
